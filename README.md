# A (very) quick and (very) dirty introduction to the UNIX command line

This class is not about the UNIX environment and the UNIX command line[^1]—we have another class for that—but knowing how a command line works and what the components of it are is an essential skill for any serious use of computers in a scientific setting. 


[^1]: When I refer to the UNIX command line here, I don't mean to imply that this particular way of interacting with a computer is exclusively a UNIX feature. The command line was used before UNIX and variants such as DOS developed later. The particular way of interpreting a command line, and in particular the way to connect commands in pipelines, however, originated in UNIX.
